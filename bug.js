This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The problem is that Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode doesn't correctly purge unused CSS classes when using dynamic class names generated client-side. This leads to an increase in bundle size and potentially slower load times. The issue is often harder to debug because it only occurs in production builds or after deploying to a server.
