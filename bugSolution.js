The solution depends on the framework and the specific implementation of dynamic class names, but some common approaches are:

**1. Whitelisting Critical Classes:** Add the classes to be used to the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` (Next.js) or equivalent.  This works well for known classes, but not for dynamically generated ones.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: {
    content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js'],
    options: {
      whitelist: ['my-dynamic-class', 'another-dynamic-class']
    }
  },
  // ... rest of the configuration
}
```

**2. Custom PurgeCSS Configuration:**  If you cannot whitelist all dynamic classes, you can configure PurgeCSS to more aggressively purge classes. This requires understanding of your applications class generation logic. This is usually done through a custom purge plugin.

**3. Refactoring Components:** The most robust solution is to reduce the amount of dynamic classes generated. Consider refactoring your component structure to use fewer or more predictable classes.  This will result in a more maintainable codebase and smaller build size.

**4. Using a Framework Specific Solution:** Some frameworks offer built-in features to manage this issue, investigate those options before resorting to custom solutions.
